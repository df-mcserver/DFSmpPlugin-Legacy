# DFSmpPlugin-Legacy
A repository archiving the original [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/) (1.21.3) plugin used for Season 1 and Season 2.  
The code provided is for Season 2, as the code base was adapted from Season 1 (and I've lost the Season 1 source code since)

> [!WARNING]
> Do not expect this code to work. It is outdated and not well written.  
> If you want to try this plugin, download the jar file from the latest release.  
> Again, do not expect this plugin to work. I will not help you try to use this plugin, the code is provided as-is.
